## Nuclear Power and geopolitics

#### Why is nuclear power moving towards Asia when Europe is backing out after the Chornobyl accident? (is it development/precaution or future concern?)

For Asian countries, they are mostly leaning towards nuclear energy from their economics and increasing their energy demands perspective. Also nuclear power is green energy and sustainable for the environment as a lot of asian countries are depended on fossil fuel energy and they are going under the minimum percentage of forest a country should have. So, with growing industries and populations,if nuclear power is handled with proper precaution, it is the most consistent energy option for their overall energy mix to ensure energy security and meet their rising electricity needs. 

However, it is noteworthy that nuclear power is not entirely absent in Europe. Countries like France and Sweden,still heavily rely on nuclear energy for electricity. Also, some countries are embracing advanced nuclear technologies, such as small modular reactors and fusion, hoping to lead to a reevaluation of nuclear power in the future. 

There might be two reasons behind this. 
1.Western Europe’s Nuclear Need 
2.Eastern Europe’s Nuclear Conflicts 

Germany : All the NPPs are shut down (most recently by April 2023). 

Italy :  After 1986 rejected all plans. 
- In 2007 Was thinking about a restoration attempt  
- In 2011 banned the use of nuclear power as the result of a referendum. 

Austria : In 1978, held a referendum on building an NPP, the citizens voted against nuclear power, never operated.  
- In the 1960s, three small nuclear reactors were built for scientific purposes, and only one of these plants is still being operated. 

Switzerland :  In 1990, held a referendum, citizens supported a ten-year moratorium on building new NPPs, but the four existing plants continued in operation.  
- In 2017, the Swiss government rejected the construction of new NPPs. 

UK : have plans to close all the NPPs by 2035. 

Belgium : have plans to close most of the NPPs by 2025, others by 2035. 

France :  68% of the country's annual electricity generation comes from NPPs. 

Netherlands : one NPP reactor in operation, one NPP in safe enclosure, two research reactors, one enrichment plant 

Ireland : In 1999, electricity produced by nuclear fission was banned. 

Russia : In 1987–2000, stopped building NPPs. 
- In the twenty-first century, Russia resumed the use of nuclear energy, Rosatom corporation consists of 360 enterprises and currently building NPPs in twelve countries. 

Belarus : has returned to the use of NPPs.  
- In 2021, the first Belarusian NPP operated. 
- By 2023, another NPP will start operating. 
          
Lithuania : closed its NPP (the sole source of 70 percent of its electricity) 

Poland : In the 1990 referendum, 86 percent of citizens voted against the use of nuclear power.  
- Proposal of own NPP in operation by 2030. 
   
The Czech Republic : has six reactors in operation and more in future. 

Slovakia : active four nuclear reactors. 
- In 2004, had to close two reactors as a condition of joining the EU. 

Ukraine : more than half the electricity produced from NPPs. 

The Chernobyl disaster majorly impacted on Europe's perception of nuclear power. EU is concerned about the safety of nuclear reactors and their potential for catastrophic consequences. Phasing out or reduce their reliance on nuclear power was influenced by public sentiment, political factors, and a desire to prioritize other alternative energy sources such as renewable energy. Long-term environmental impact of nuclear power played a role as well. Issues such as radioactive waste disposal, the risk of accidents, and the potential for nuclear proliferation have raised questions about the sustainability and desirability of nuclear energy. 

#### Is this the reason why Asia is not interested in Russian-Ukrainian war? 

The conflict between Russia and Ukraine is geographically distant from most Asian countries, and their immediate security concerns might be focused somewhere else. It's also true that the Russian-Ukrainian war has impacted global security and geopolitics, and some Asian countries' interests lies in the outcome (like China shares a border with Russia).  

Again economic or political ties (foreign policy objectives) to either Russia or Ukraine impacted the support for each country. Countries with significant trade or investment links to either country tends to have a stronger incentive to monitor the situation closely due to potential economic repercussions. 

#### Comparison with the Zaporizhzhya NPP that is currently playing a role in the Russian-Ukrainian warfare; comparison with Fukushima in how it’s handled & aftermath. 

As the Zaporizhzhia NPP was taken over by Russian army. With continued shelling around the plant repeatedly cutting access to the electricity grid, it's last working reactor were planned to shut down. A stable electricity supply is important for any nuclear power plant to maintain cooling systems for radioactive fuel. Zaporizhzhia does have diesel generators to switch on when the primary electricity supply is cut, but they are not a long-term solution. The exact situation of not having continuous electricity to run the reactor worsened the situation of Chornobyl in the past, and also at Fukushima for the earthquake. Disaster at Zaporizhzhia, caused either by an accident or a deliberate attack, residents in Ukrainian towns and villages nearby could face the threat of radiation poisoning immediately or within a few hours. 

#### Ukraine’s Dam collapse  

The destruction of the colossal Nova Kakhovka dam is the draining water supplies, farming in the region and the cooling of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. Tons of oil have been leaked & mixed with water, which will eventually fall into the Dnipro River and potentially the Black Sea.  

Kyiv has long warned of the danger of an attack on the dam. In this state, the dam’s destruction in the Kherson region is indicating towards a potential war crime which leads to another devastating consequence of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. 

## Prevalence of nuclear power globally
While a significant portion of the world’s energy is generated by nuclear power, its use has been declining since a peak in the early 2000s, driven by a combination of political opposition and the rise of cheap energy sources such as natural gas. The global stockpile of nuclear weapons also declined in the 1990s and early 2000s, driven by the disarmament of primary weapon holders (the U.S. and Russia); however, this decline has plateaued since the beginning of the 2010s.

## Modern-day applications of nuclear power {.cards}
Nuclear power has a variety of uses beyond pure electricity production, many of which are derived from the byproducts of nuclear energy generation.

### Hydrogen production
Nuclear power can be utilized to produce hydrogen, an increasingly important ingredient in the production of chemicals like ammonia and methanol as well as the manufacture of fuel cells. Currently, hydrogen production is dominated by fossil fuels, making nuclear power an alternative that does not produce greenhouse gas emissions.

### District heating
District heating systems, which allow buildings in an area to be heated from the steam or heated water produced at one or multiple nearby power plants, can use that produced by nuclear power plants.

### Desalination
The combined heat and electricity produced by a nuclear reactor from an onshore plant or floating vessel can be used in the desalination of seawater.

### Industrial process heating
While many renewable energy sources can produce the heat needed for low-temperature industrial process heating, nuclear power is able to provide the high temperatures necessary for other industrial processes.

### Radioisotope production
Nuclear reactors and other nuclear technologies can be used to produce the radioisotopes necessary for medical equipment, research applications like carbon dating, and the production of technology like smoke detectors.

### Utilizing waste products
Waste products from other industries, such as thorium and copper, have the potential to be utilized in or transformed into useful material by nuclear power.

## Issues with modern nuclear power
While nuclear power is an efficient power source with a large number of applications, it has some significant issues that have generated pushback against its use.

#### Safety concerns
.ve-media width=70% wc:Chornobyl_radiation_map.jpg right
Accidents, including fatal ones, can and do happen in any industry. However, serious accidents at nuclear power plants can have consequences that extend beyond a human time scale: if significant amounts of radioactive contamination enter the environment surrounding a power plant as a result of an accident, it has the potential to disrupt food sources, endanger human health, and even render an area uninhabitable for tens of thousands of years. The accidents at Chornobyl and Fukushima are the only two nuclear accidents to have reached such a scale.

#### Waste transportation and storage
.ve-media width=70% wc:Transport-UNF-Japan.jpg right
Nuclear power generation produces small, but not insignificant, amounts of radioactive waste. This waste must be transported from plants to storage locations, where it must then be left undisturbed for time periods spanning up to hundreds of thousands of years.

#### Power plants and weapons
.ve-media width=70% wc:IAEA_Uranium_Fuel_Bank_(2).jpg right
The same materials used to power nuclear reactors-- isotopes like uranium-235 and plutonium-239-- can be used in the creation of nuclear weapons. Critics of nuclear power point to concerns that countries with uranium refining and plutonium reprocessing capabilities to make these isotopes usable for nuclear fuel can also utilize them in the development of nuclear weapons, reversing previous advancements in nuclear disarmament.

#### Costs
Nuclear power plants are expensive to build, with initial investments costing several billions of dollars, as well as operate. Most of these costs come from the extensive safety features and oversight required in order to make sure that a new power plant can operate safely and shut down without issue in the event of a potential emergency.

## Innovations in nuclear energy generation
The U.S. nuclear energy industry is dominated by the light water reactor (LWR), a type of reactor that uses water as a coolant. In light of the prohibitively high costs that have thus far discouraged the construction of any new nuclear power plants, there has been rising interest among some proponents of nuclear energy in the use of non-light water reactors (NLWRs), which use other materials as a coolant. NLWRs have been advertised as safer and potentially cheaper alternatives to LWRs. However, several international NGOs have released reports concluding that these reactors do not offer significantly improved-- and sometimes even worse-- safety and efficiency capabilities compared to those of existing LWR designs.

## Social media and disaster tourism

## A future for nuclear power
Despite the immense risks and downsides of nuclear power, it is ultimately necessary in the global fight against climate change. Nuclear power is a source of efficient and reliable energy that, while posing potential dangers, is key to a successful transition from our current energy economy to one that produces net zero or net negative emissions by 2050 in order to prevent catastrophic levels of warming. With this in mind, it is essential that governments maintain existing nuclear energy infrastructure and support its use as part of clean energy transition strategies.
