## Nuclear Power and geopolitics



#### Why is nuclear power moving towards Asia when Europe is backing out after the Chornobyl accident?(is it development/pre-caution or future concern?  {href=#}

For Asian countries, they are mostly leaning towards nuclear energy from their economics and increasing their energy demands perspective. Also nuclear power is green energy and sustainable for the environment as a lot of asian countries are depended on fossil fuel energy and they are going under the minimum percentage of forest a country should have. So, with growing industries and populations,if nuclear power is handled with proper precaution, it is the most consistent energy option for their overall energy mix to ensure energy security and meet their rising electricity needs.

However, it is noteworthy that nuclear power is not entirely absent in Europe. Countries like France and Sweden,still heavily rely on nuclear energy for electricity. Also, some countries are embracing advanced nuclear technologies, such as small modular reactors and fusion, hoping to lead to a reevaluation of nuclear power in the future.

There might be two reasons behind this.

1.Western Europe’s Nuclear Need
2.Eastern Europe’s Nuclear Conflicts

Germany : All the NPPs are shut down (most recently by April 2023).

Italy :  After 1986 rejected all plans.
         In 2007 Was thinking about a restoration attempt 
         In 2011 banned the use of nuclear power as the result of a referendum.

Austria : In 1978, held a referendum on building an NPP, the citizens voted against nuclear power, never operated. 
          In the 1960s, three small nuclear reactors were built for scientific purposes, and only one of these plants 
          is still being operated.

Switzerland :  In 1990, held a referendum, citizens supported a ten-year moratorium on building new NPPs, but the 
               four existing plants continued in operation. 
               In 2017, the Swiss government rejected the construction of new NPPs.

UK : have plans to close all the NPPs by 2035.

Belgium : have plans to close most of the NPPs by 2025, others by 2035.

France :  68% of the country's annual electricity generation comes from NPPs.

Netherlands : one NPP reactor in operation, one NPP in safe enclosure, two research reactors, one enrichment plant

Ireland : In 1999, electricity produced by nuclear fission was banned.


Russia : In 1987–2000, stopped building NPPs.
         In the twenty-first century, Russia resumed the use of nuclear energy, Rosatom corporation consists of 360 
         enterprises and currently building NPPs in twelve countries.

Belarus : has returned to the use of NPPs. 
          In 2021, the first Belarusian NPP operated.
          By 2023, another NPP will start operating.

Lithuania : closed its NPP (the sole source of 70 percent of its electricity)

Poland : In the 1990 referendum, 86 percent of citizens voted against the use of nuclear power. 
         proposal of own NPP in operation by 2030.

The Czech Republic : has six reactors in operation and more in future.

Slovakia : active four nuclear reactors.
           In 2004, had to close two reactors as a condition of joining the EU.

Ukraine : more than half the electricity produced from NPPs.



The Chernobyl disaster majorly impacted on Europe's perception of nuclear power. EU is concerned about the safety of nuclear reactors and their potential for catastrophic consequences. Phasing out or reduce their reliance on nuclear power was influenced by public sentiment, political factors, and a desire to prioritize other alternative energy sources such as renewable energy. Long-term environmental impact of nuclear power played a role as well. Issues such as radioactive waste disposal, the risk of accidents, and the potential for nuclear proliferation have raised questions about the sustainability and desirability of nuclear energy.


## Prevalence of nuclear power globally

.ve-map 
- geojson=/katyalittle/essays/plants.geojson layer="Label for Layer"

While a significant portion of the world’s energy is generated by nuclear power, its use has been declining since a peak in the early 2000s, driven by a combination of political opposition and the rise of cheap energy sources such as natural gas. The global stockpile of nuclear weapons also declined in the 1990s and early 2000s, driven by the disarmament of primary weapon holders (the U.S. and Russia); however, this decline has plateaued since the beginning of the 2010s.

## Modern-day applications of nuclear power {.cards}
Nuclear power has a variety of uses beyond pure electricity production, many of which are derived from the byproducts of nuclear energy generation.

### Hydrogen production
Nuclear power can be utilized to produce hydrogen, an increasingly important ingredient in the production of chemicals like ammonia and methanol as well as the manufacture of fuel cells. Currently, hydrogen production is dominated by fossil fuels, making nuclear power an alternative that does not produce greenhouse gas emissions.

### District heating
District heating systems, which allow buildings in an area to be heated from the steam or heated water produced at one or multiple nearby power plants, can use that produced by nuclear power plants.

### Desalination
The combined heat and electricity produced by a nuclear reactor from an onshore plant or floating vessel can be used in the desalination of seawater.

### Industrial process heating
While many renewable energy sources can produce the heat needed for low-temperature industrial process heating, nuclear power is able to provide the high temperatures necessary for other industrial processes.

### Radioisotope production
Nuclear reactors and other nuclear technologies can be used to produce the radioisotopes necessary for medical equipment, research applications like carbon dating, and the production of technology like smoke detectors.

### Utilizing waste products
Waste products from other industries, such as thorium and copper, have the potential to be utilized in or transformed into useful material by nuclear power.

## Issues with modern nuclear power
While nuclear power is an efficient power source with a large number of applications, it has some significant issues that have generated pushback against its use.

#### Safety concerns
Accidents, including fatal ones, can and do happen in any industry. However, serious accidents at nuclear power plants can have consequences that extend beyond a human time scale: if significant amounts of radioactive contamination enter the environment surrounding a power plant as a result of an accident, it has the potential to disrupt food sources, endanger human health, and even render an area uninhabitable for tens of thousands of years. The accidents at Chornobyl and Fukushima are the only two nuclear accidents to have reached such a scale. The nature of such accidents has also prompted concerns about nuclear power plants as military or terrorist targets.
