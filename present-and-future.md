## Nuclear Power and geopolitics

### Geopolitics

#### Why is nuclear power moving towards Asia when Europe is backing out after the Chornobyl accident?(is it development/pre-caution or future concern?

## Prevalence of nuclear power globally
While a significant portion of the world’s energy is generated by nuclear power, its use has been declining since a peak in the early 2000s, driven by a combination of political opposition and the rise of cheap energy sources such as natural gas. The global stockpile of nuclear weapons also declined in the 1990s and early 2000s, driven by the disarmament of primary weapon holders (the U.S. and Russia); however, this decline has plateaued since the beginning of the 2010s.

## Modern-day applications of nuclear power {.cards}
Nuclear power has a variety of uses beyond pure electricity production, many of which are derived from the byproducts of nuclear energy generation.

### Hydrogen production
Nuclear power can be utilized to produce hydrogen, an increasingly important ingredient in the production of chemicals like ammonia and methanol as well as the manufacture of fuel cells. Currently, hydrogen production is dominated by fossil fuels, making nuclear power an alternative that does not produce greenhouse gas emissions.

### District heating
District heating systems, which allow buildings in an area to be heated from the steam or heated water produced at one or multiple nearby power plants, can use that produced by nuclear power plants.

### Desalination
The combined heat and electricity produced by a nuclear reactor from an onshore plant or floating vessel can be used in the desalination of seawater.

### Industrial process heating
While many renewable energy sources can produce the heat needed for low-temperature industrial process heating, nuclear power is able to provide the high temperatures necessary for other industrial processes.

### Radioisotope production
Nuclear reactors and other nuclear technologies can be used to produce the radioisotopes necessary for medical equipment, research applications like carbon dating, and the production of technology like smoke detectors.

### Utilizing waste products
Waste products from other industries, such as thorium and copper, have the potential to be utilized in or transformed into useful material by nuclear power.

## Issues with modern nuclear power
While nuclear power is an efficient power source with a large number of applications, it has some significant issues that have generated pushback against its use.

#### Safety concerns
Accidents, including fatal ones, can and do happen in any industry. However, serious accidents at nuclear power plants can have consequences that extend beyond a human time scale: if significant amounts of radioactive contamination enter the environment surrounding a power plant as a result of an accident, it has the potential to disrupt food sources, endanger human health, and even render an area uninhabitable for tens of thousands of years. The accidents at Chornobyl and Fukushima are the only two nuclear accidents to have reached such a scale.

#### Waste transportation and storage
Nuclear power generation produces small, but not insignificant, amounts of radioactive waste. This waste must be transported from plants to storage locations, where it must then be left undisturbed for time periods spanning up to hundreds of thousands of years.

#### Power plants and weapons
The same materials used to power nuclear reactors-- isotopes like uranium-235 and plutonium-239-- can be used in the creation of nuclear weapons. Critics of nuclear power point to concerns that countries with uranium refining and plutonium reprocessing capabilities to make these isotopes usable for nuclear fuel can also utilize them in the development of nuclear weapons, reversing previous advancements in nuclear disarmament.

#### Costs
Nuclear power plants are expensive to build, with initial investments costing several billions of dollars, as well as operate. Most of these costs come from the extensive safety features and oversight required in order to make sure that a new power plant can operate safely and shut down without issue in the event of a potential emergency.

## Innovations in nuclear energy generation
The U.S. nuclear energy industry is dominated by the light water reactor (LWR), a type of reactor that uses water as a coolant. In light of the prohibitively high costs that have thus far discouraged the construction of any new nuclear power plants, there has been rising interest among some proponents of nuclear energy in the use of non-light water reactors (NLWRs), which use other materials as a coolant. NLWRs have been advertised as safer and potentially cheaper alternatives to LWRs. However, several international NGOs have released reports concluding that these reactors do not offer significantly improved-- and sometimes even worse-- safety and efficiency capabilities compared to those of existing LWR designs.

## A future for nuclear power
Despite the immense risks and downsides of nuclear power, it is ultimately necessary to the global fight against climate change. Groups like the United Nations Development Programme, International Energy Agency, Union of Concerned Scientists have all endorsed nuclear power as source of efficient and reliable energy that, while posing potential dangers, is key to a successful transition from our current energy economy to one that produces net zero or net negative emissions. With this in mind, it is an essential that governments maintain existing nuclear energy infrastructure and support its use as part of clean energy transition strategies.
